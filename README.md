# Covid-19-vaccination
The data was taken from here - https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data.
For training purposes, I wanted to build data pipeline of covid-19 vaccinations.
Using the pandas library, I converted the data and then uploaded it to Elasticsearch
and built a schedule of vaccination rates in different countries in Kibana.
I also automated the workflow using Airflow
